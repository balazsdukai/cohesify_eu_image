# Data quality

Besides the issues specific to each variable, these issues are generally present at most/all variables:

+ The NUTS 2013 level 2 region *FRA5* is a new region, thus it has no corresponding region in the earlier NUTS versions. Therefore the variables have missing values in case they are originally mapped to NUTS regions of 2006/2010 version.

+ Between NUTS versions 2010 and 2013 the NUTS3 region *SI035* (in *SI03*) is a merge of *SI021* (in *SI02*) and *SI015* (in *SI01*). Eight out of nine of the 2010 level 3 regions corresponding to the 2013 level 2 region *SI03* were part of the *SI01* 2010 level 2 region. The only exception is *SI021* (from *SI02*). At the time of the study there was no population data available for NUTS 2010 regions that could be used to weight the variables that are translated from NUTS2/3 2010 to NUTS2 2013. Therefore the 2013 region *SI03* is considered to be a name change from *SI01* to *SI03*, ignoring the influence of *SI021*. This affects the variables `sgi_aggregated, migration_2013, eu_id_type_code, soc_idx`.

# Output

Due to the large number of NUTS2 regions with missing values at many variables, three outputs are prepared:

**`eu_all.csv`**

All regions included, even those that contain missing values for the independent variables. Regions are excluded that are missing values for either of the dependent variables `EU identificaion` or `EU attachment`.

Contains 261/276 NUTS2 regions. Excluded regions are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
eu_vars_ri_n$id2.2013
```

**`eu_no_missing.csv`**

Regions are removed that are missing value for any variable.

Contains 251/276 NUTS2 regions. Excluded regions are those listed in the previous output and:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
eu_vars_no_na_n
```

**`eu_include.csv`**

Removed all regions where the value for the NUTS2 region is a generalization of NUTS0/1 values, because of missing data on the NUTS2 level.

Contains 125/276 NUTS2 regions. Excluded regions are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
eu_vars_exclude
```
